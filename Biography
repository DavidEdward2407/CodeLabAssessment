/*3.Create a program that prints your name, hometown and age to the console. The program has the following constraints:

Each item should be stored using a variable of an appropriate data type.
Each item should be printed on a new line.
You can only use cout once.
Advanced requirements
Have the user input the values for name, hometown and age
Try giving the program both your first and second name when asked. What do you notice? Can you provide a fix?
Try entering a string or letter value when asked to enter your age. What happens? Can you provide a fix?
If completing the optional requirements you may use cout more than once to request user input. 
However the output of information must be performed with a single cout*/

#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main(){
    string name = "";//using one variable to store first and last name
    string hometown= "";//variable to store the input for hometown
    //int age;//variable to store the age
    string age = "";
    
    cout<<"What's your name? : ";//first question
    getline(cin, name);// had to use getline function to get to store my full name. otherwise just my first name gets stored
    
    cout<<"What's your hometown? : ";
    cin>>hometown;//my hometown is only one word so i can use cin instead of getline
    
    cout<<"And lastly what's your age? : ";
    //cin>>age;//if using to get a integer as value for age
    getline(cin, age);//with this it can store the age in numerical form and written form

    cout<<"This guys Biography is below."<<"\nName : "<<name<<"\nHometown : "<<hometown<<"\nAge : "<<age;//the display method in one line using \n
    
    return 0;
}
