/*Write a simple search engine that tests if a string is present in a string array. 
The array you need to declare should be initialised with the following values 
"Jake" "Zac", "Ian", "Ron", "Sam", "Dave". The string you are searching for is "Sam"

Your program should loop the array and test each array index against the search term. 
If the search term is found the program should output an appropriate message

Optional Requirements
Allow the user to enter the name to be searched*/
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // variable with all the names
    string names[] = {"Jake", "Zac", "Ian", "Ron", "Sam", "Dave"};

    //variable that will store the input from the user
    string searchName;
    //prompt and input for user to input the name to be searched
    cout << "Enter the name to search for: ";
    cin >> searchName;

    //variable used to validate the condition if the name is found or not
    bool found = false;
    //for loop to check the input from user and the list of names
    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
        if (names[i] == searchName) {
            found = true;
            break;
        }

    } else {
        cout << searchName << " was NOT found in the list." << endl;
