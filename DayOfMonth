/*You are a freelance calendar maker. Unfortunately, like me, you are useless are remembering how many 
 * days there are in each month of the year.

Write a program that uses a switch statement to tell a user how many days there are in a month.

Your cases should test a number corresponding to the months (e.g. 1 = January, 12 = December), 
 * and cases should print out how many days there are in a month.*/

    //switch case with the duration of each month of this year
