/*You are an inexperienced hacker trying to find the correct password to enter a safe...

Write a programme that defines the correct password as 12345, and allows users to enter password attempts until 
they reach the correct answer.
Your programme should use a while loop to allow the user to keep entering password attempts until correct. 
Once the correct password is entered the program should output an appropriate message e.g "Welcome to the Secure Area"
Optional Requirements
Modify the solution to Brute-Force Attack to include a maximum of 5 password attempts. 
Each time the user enters an incorrect password, they should be told how many password attempts remain. 
If there are 5 failed password attempts the while loop should end and the program should inform the user 
that the authorities have been alerted!*/
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    const int correctPassword = 12345;//variable for the correct password
    int userInput;//variable to store the input from user
    int attemptsLeft = 5;//number of attempts
    
    cout << "Enter the password to access the safe:\n";
    //outer while loop that check to see if you have attempts left 
    while (attemptsLeft > 0) {
        cout << "Password: ";
        cin >> userInput;//password input from user
        
        //inner if/else loop that check if you entered the correct password
        if (userInput == correctPassword) {
            //if you enter the correct password you get the message below
            cout << "Welcome to the Secure Area!" << endl;
            break;
            //if you get the password wrong it moves to the else part of the loop
        } else {
            //removes one attempt 
            attemptsLeft--;
            //last inner if/else loop to check if you have any remaining attempts left or used to many attempts
            if (attemptsLeft > 0) {
                cout << "Incorrect password. Attempts remaining: " << attemptsLeft << endl;
            } else {
                cout << "Too many failed attempts. The authorities have been alerted!" << endl;
            }
        }
